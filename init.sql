Add the besan at this point and mix it into the dal mixture and ensure it blends well without any lumps.Continue stirring the puran poli mixture until the dal mixture begins to thicken and leaves the sides of the pan.At this point turn off the heat and allow the puran poli mixture to cool completely. Divide the dough and puran mixture into 6 portions.Keeping a little flour for dusting handy on a plate; roll out the puran poli dough into 3 inch diameter circles.Place a portion of the puran poli mixture into the center of the circle.Bring edges of the circle towards the center and fold over to cover the entire filling; making sure the edges are all sealed well by pinching them together if there is any opening.Flatten the stuffed dough; dust over a little flour and roll gently into a 4 to 6 inch diameter circle taking care not to put too much pressure as the puran can come out of the dough.Preheat a skillet on medium high; place the rolled puran poli onto the skillet to cook until golden brown on both sides. At this point you can cook it along with ghee to make the puran poli crisp and delicious. Or you can make a dry puran poli and serve it along with ghee.Repeat the above process for all the remaining dough and puran portions.Serve the Gujarati Puran Poli hot with ghee smeared on the top as it is or along with Undhiyu and Gujarati Kadhi to make a delicious meal.',NULL);

The batter will look fluffy.Grind the rice and millet mixture into a smooth batter| adding just the required amount of water to grind into an almost smooth batter. Adding too much water will make the mixture too watery. Combine the urad and rice batter| add salt to taste and set aside for at least 12 hours or overnight until the batter ferments. You will notice the batter would have risen in volume.Hence you should place the batter in a large container so it has enough room to increase in its volume.*Note on fermenting the Ragi Idli & Dosa BatterFermenting has to take place where the weather is warm. So ideally in summer| the batter ferments very well and doubles or triples its quantity.But in cold places| the batter has to be kept in an oven. If your oven has a light| then turn on the light for a few hours with the batter in the oven.Once the oven is warm| turn off the light and let the batter ferment. If your oven does not have a light| then preheat the oven to warm| turn off oven then keep the batter in the oven to ferment.

Which is one of the popular cuisine of India. The bread is rolled very thin| thus the name “Rumali”. As the word literally means Handkerchief in punjabi. It is an art to make this bread as you require certain technique and experience to make it so thin. But you can also roll it thin using a rolling pin. The bread is then traditionally cooked on an “Ulte Tawa or Kadai” which is nothing but a wok that is turned over.','Punjabi','Side Dish','Vegetarian','Total in 35 M','-- 1 cup All Purpose Flour (Maida) -- 1/4 cup Curd (Dahi / Yogurt) -- 1 tablespoon Oil --Salt | to taste --Lukewarm Water | to knead  -','To begin making the Rumali Roti Recipe| mix all the ingredients together and knead it into a soft dough.Rest the dough for around 10 minutes. Then knead one last time and pinch out a small portion from the dough.Toss it on the flour and roll out into thin circles to approximately 6 inches in diameter. As you roll them out| you can keep tossing the dough in dry flour while rolling; this will prevent it from getting sticky when rolling them out.Roll it as thin as possible. Tip: It is a good idea to roll out a batch of dough so it gets easier to cook the entire batch. Although Gujarati ladies are very quick in rolling and cooking them simultaneously; this comes with practice of rolling and understanding the heat of your skillet.Heat a dosa tawa so that you can cook the big roti well. Place rolled dough on the hot skillet. In a few seconds you will notice that small air pockets start to form. At this point flip the rolled dough to cook the other side on the skillet.Serve the Rumali Roti Recipe| along with Butter chicken or Paneer Kadai to enjoy your lunch.',NULL);
